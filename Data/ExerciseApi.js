        des: `Squats are a great exercise for strengthening your lower body, particularly your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and lower back. Here's how to perform a basic squat with proper form:

        **1. Warm-Up:** Before starting any exercise, it's essential to warm up to prevent injury. Spend 5-10 minutes doing light cardio, such as jogging in place or jumping jacks, to increase blood flow to your muscles.
        
        **2. Stand with Proper Posture:**
           - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be pointing slightly outward.
           - Keep your back straight, chest up, and shoulders relaxed.
        
        **3. Perform the Squat:**
           - Begin by pushing your hips back, as if you're about to sit in a chair. Imagine that you're sticking your butt out behind you.
           - As you lower your body, bend your knees. Keep your knees in line with your toes; don't let them collapse inward.
           - Go as low as you can while maintaining good form. Ideally, your thighs should be parallel to the ground, or you can go deeper if you're comfortable.
           - Ensure your weight is on your heels, and your knees don't extend past your toes.
           - Keep your core engaged by tightening your abdominal muscles.
        
        **4. Return to the Starting Position:**
           - Push through your heels to stand back up, straightening your legs and returning to the starting position.
           - Make sure to keep your back straight throughout the movement.
        
        **5. Repeat:**
           - Aim for 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions to start, or adjust based on your fitness level.
           - Rest for 30-60 seconds between sets.
        
        **Tips:**
        - Focus on your breathing. Inhale as you lower your body and exhale as you stand up.
        - Maintain a neutral spine by looking straight ahead or slightly upward, not down at the ground.
        - Keep your weight balanced evenly between both feet.
        - If you're new to squats or have mobility issues, you can start with bodyweight squats and progress to using dumbbells or a barbell as you become more comfortable and stronger.
        - To add variety, you can try different squat variations like goblet squats, sumo squats, or Bulgarian split squats.
        
        It's essential to perform squats with proper form to avoid injury. If you're unsure about your technique or have any health concerns, consider working with a certified fitness trainer to ensure you're doing squats correctly and safely.`,
